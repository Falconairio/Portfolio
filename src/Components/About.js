                    <p>Hi, Iâ€™m a programming wizard in training. My journey has just started, but I hope to grow my career to the point where I can have a positive impact on the world. I had taken coding classes over my four years of high school, but it was not until October 2019 that I took my first step in my web development career by attending the Ironhack school. I am always looking to learn new technologies and use them in fun and creative ways. Below, you can find projects that I have worked on and my contact info.</p>
